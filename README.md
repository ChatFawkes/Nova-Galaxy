#Nova Galaxy
Repository for the Nova Galaxy Modpack

####Contains:
- Mods
- Configs (via submodule)
- Build scripts for various zips
- Issue/Feedback Tracker (to the right)

####How to compile the modpack:
Windows: Run BuildZips.bat  
Linux/OSX: Run BuildZips.sh

This creates the client and server zip archives. It also creates a configs zip, but that is only needed by me.
